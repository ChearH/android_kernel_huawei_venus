# Huawei P9 Lite Kernel

- How to build

Alright it's pretty easy, you need an ARM64 toolchain, you can get it at google's git server. Then you just need to edit 'build.sh' and point it to your toolchain, then just run './build.sh' and you're good to go.

If you want to compile Android and the kernel at the same time, use Android.mk

- Changes

None at the moment, just the kernel directly from the source provided by Huawei
